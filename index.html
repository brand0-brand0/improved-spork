        <h1>Changing your GitHub repository from private to public is a straightforward process. Here’s how you can do it:</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to Your Repository: Log into your GitHub account, go to your dashboard, and click on the repository you want to change to public.</li>
            <li>Go to Settings: Once you’re in your repository, look for the "Settings" tab near the top-right corner of the page and click on it.</li>
            <li>Find the "Danger Zone": Scroll all the way down to the bottom of the settings page until you find a section labeled "Danger Zone".</li>
            <li>Change Repository Visibility: In the Danger Zone, you’ll see a button or link that says "Change repository visibility". Click on it.</li>
            <li>Choose Public: You will be prompted to confirm your action. Select “Public” to make your repository visible to anyone.</li>
            <li>Confirm the Change: GitHub will ask you to type your repository name to confirm that you want to change the visibility to public. This is a safety measure to ensure you understand the action you’re taking.</li>
            <li>Complete the Change: After typing your repository name, click on the button to change the visibility to public. This might be labeled "I understand, change repository visibility", or something similar.</li>
        </ol>
